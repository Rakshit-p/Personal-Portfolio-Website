      <h1>Ohm's law</h1>
      <h2>The mathematical statement of Ohm’s law is expressed as:</h2>
      <h2>V=IR</h2>

      <p>
        In this equation, V is the potential difference between the surfaces of a
        conductor, and I the current across those surfaces, implying the direction of the
        flow of current is perpendicular to either of the surfaces. R is a proportionality
        constant called resistance.
      </p>

      <p>The resistance R of a conductor is related quantitatively to its dimensions
        and the type of material in it. The dimension means its length and the cross
        sectional area. The dimensions and the material content of a conductor are
        independent to each other, and therefore, in mathematical language, may be
        considered independent variables; and R, being dependent on both the
        variables, is the dependent variable.
      </p>

      <p>To arrive at the function connecting the variables, I called upon the basic
        concepts of electricity I have learnt in my grade 12. I discovered that the act of
        connecting a conductor to a battery creates two equipotential surfaces,
        sandwiching a uniform electric field. The constancy of the electric field is a
        consequence of the concept of electric field lines. The lines in this case are
        straight lines and parallel to each other, running perpendicular to the surfaces.
        This led me to get at the function given below:
      </p>

      <h3>R = ρ × L/A</h3>

      <p>
        Here L is the distance between the equipotential surfaces, or the length of the
        conductor and A is surface area. The proportionality constant ρ, called resistivity,
        represents the material content of the conductor. The conductors are
        distinguished from each other by this constant.
      </p>

      <h4>Derivables from the Ohm’s Law:</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>1. The electric wires carrying currents to our homes run hundreds of
          kilometers from the power stations. The electric field in the wire
          between two stations must be constant.</li>
        <li>2. The gravitational field lines, unlike electric field lines, do not
          terminate. These span out through the gigantic interstellar space to
          rule over our earth and the heaven.</li>
        <li>3. The analysis aligns with a well established method in physics-
          separation of variables. The independent variables of a conductor are
          separated to be multiplied to give its resistance.</li>
        <li>4. The Ohm’s law may be related to other phenomena in nature. The
          analogies are narrated in the table below.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Table</h4>
      <!--<p>
        The Ohm’s Law Analogy
        1 The flow of something (electrons) between two equipotential surfaces through a uniform field (electric).
        The flow of something (raindrops) in a uniform gravitational field. I could imagine the cloud of raindrops to be a spherical equipotential surface around the earth. As compared to the radius of the earth, the distance of this imaginary
        spherical shell from the surface is negligible. Therefore, the gravitational field at any point in the intervening space may be considered to be a constant.
        2 The two independent variables, namely, resistivity and dimensions, of a conductor are multiplied to obtain the determining factor of the flow of something (current) through it.
        The electric permittivity and magnetic permittivity are two independent properties of free space. Therefore, both the variables must be multiplied to obtain the determining factor of the flow of something (electromagnetic wave) through the
        space. As a matter of fact, Maxwell determined the velocity of light without doing any experiment.
