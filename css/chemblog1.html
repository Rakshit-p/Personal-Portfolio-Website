      <h1>My tryst with reactions...</h1>
      <p>To acquire some rudimentary practical knowledge in chemistry, I spent spare time as an assistant in a laboratory that is quite modern and well equipped. This helped me observe how the reactions are conducted and monitored in a
        laboratory. The experience helped me familiarize with some basic laboratory techniques such as filtration, distillation, determination of Rf value etc. </p>
      <p>To get a feel for the reactions I have learnt theoretically in the class, I tried my hand experimenting them in the laboratory. I selected two reactions, namely, Williamson ether synthesis and Sandmeyer reaction. I have learnt that both the
        reactions are conducted under the catalysis of a suitable copper (I) salt. Therefore, my laboratory escapades commenced with the preparation of copper (I) bromide to be used in both the reactions.</p>
      <p>For the preparation, I used copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate, a beautiful blue colored solid, as the starting material. The valency of copper in the pentahydrate salt is 2 whereas, in copper (I) bromide, the valency is 1. Therefore, from the
        theoretical point of view, the exercise is reduced to finding ways to lower the valency of copper from 2 to 1. </p>
      <p>It is a fascinating to know the existence of a chemical called sodium bisulfite, NaHSO3, that has the capacity to lower the valency of copper. To obtain copper (I) bromide, the bisulfite has to be used in combination with sodium bromide to
        get the bromide anion to combine with copper (I) cation prepared by the sulfite. Water is to be used as the medium that would dissociate the salts to their respective ions. Further, the reaction is to be conducted under alkaline conditions.
        Sodium hydroxide is used for the purpose. Probably, it is used to scavenge sulfate anions in the reaction.</p>
      <p>With help from my supervisor, I prepared cuprous bromide. I was thrown into excitement while making various observations during the reactions such as the change of color of the reaction mass from blue to cream color, and the precipitation of
        copper (I) bromide from the homogenous reaction solution. I was thrown into boundless joy when I isolated cuprous bromide from the reaction mass by filtration under an atmosphere of nitrogen. </p>
      <p>Using copper (I) bromide thus prepared as catalysts, I conducted the two experiments mentioned above. For Williamson’s ether synthesis, I used phenol and bromobenzene as starting chemicals, and sodium carbonate as the base to neutralize the
        acid that is released during the reaction. This experiment gave diphenyl ether. </p>
      <p>For Sandmeyer’s synthesis, I used two chemicals, namely, aniline and aqueous hydrobromic acid. Unlike the former, no base was used in this reaction and water was used as the reaction medium. </p>
      <p>In conducting these experiments, I familiarized myself to important techniques such as the thin layer chromatographic plates (tlc) to monitor reactions, qualitatively determining the polarity of compounds from their Rf values, calculations
        of Rf values, preparation of solvent systems for tlc and calculation of stoichiometric molar ratios of the reagents.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the experiences have been fulfilling and intellectually satisfying. I look forward to continue my exploration.</p>
