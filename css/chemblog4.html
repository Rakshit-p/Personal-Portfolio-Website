      <h2>Preparation:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Aniline (5 g, 0.053 mole) was taken in a 3 necked round bottom flask fitted with a dropping funnel and stirrer.</li>
        <li>The flask was immersed inside an ice bath.</li>
        <li>Aqueous HBr (48%, 9.3 ml) was then added drop by drop to stirred aniline at 5 OC-10 OC. </li>
        <li>Sodium Carbonate(8.445 g, 0.079 mole) and CuBr (0.5g, 0.003 mole)) were then added to the reaction mass in succession.</li>
        <li>CuBr (0.5 g, 0.003 mole)) was then added to the reaction mass at this temperature.</li>
        <li>As aqueous solution of Sodium Nitrite (7.4 g, 0.107 mole) was then added to the reaction mass at this temperature.</li>
        <li>The temperature of the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>NOTE:</h2>
      <p>I have not completed the reaction due to time constraint.</p>
