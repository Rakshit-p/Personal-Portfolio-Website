      <h2>Preparation:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Phenol (5 g, 0.531 mole) was taken in a 3 -necked round bottom flask (100 ml) fitted with a stirrer.</li>
        <li>Bromobenzene (16.6g, 0.1062 mole) was added to the reaction mass.</li>
        <li>The reaction mass was then stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Sodium Carbonate(8.445 g, 0.079 mole) and CuBr (0.5g, 0.003 mole)) were then added to the reaction mass in succession.</li>
        <li>Dean Stark apparatus was attached to the condenser that was then attached to the central neck of the round bottomed flask.</li>
        <li>The reaction was heated to 130oC (inner), and was maintained at this temperature for several hours.</li>
        <li>TLC was then taken.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Rf = Distance travelled by the reaction mass /Distance travelled by the solvent front = 2.5/5=0.5 </p>
